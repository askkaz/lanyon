title: Why I Built This
---

I recently transitioned into software development after 10 years in the aerospace industry as a systems engineer / project manager / paper folder. In my old work environment, "new exciting software" meant the ~~new~~ 5 year old version of PowerPoint. Getting new software installed on work computers took an act of congress (sometimes literally). Basically, I have a lot of catching up to do!

Despite a background in algorithms and robotics, I struggled with current industry jargon during software interviews. Most of my code was in Matlab, C++, or VBA (hey - it was the one coding tool that was always unblocked and already installed). I plan to use this space to reflect as I dive into various new (to me) web technologies and software.
